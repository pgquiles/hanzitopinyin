# hanzitopinyin

Hanzi to pinyin converter for Simplified Chinese subtitles in SubRip (SRT) format.

Makes use of a dictionary with the 25,500 most common hanzis.

Since I wrote this tool to study Chinese, it's possible to output the subtitles in 3 formats:
* 1: only pinyin
* 2: hanzi + pinyin
* 3: English + Hanzi + Pinyin

Option 3 uses DeepL to translate, which requires an API key. DeepL provides free API keys with some limitations but they should be enough for this tool.
